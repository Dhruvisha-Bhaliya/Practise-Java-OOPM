4. Implement an infinite loop, through all looping structures.

“true” it is never terminated.)

        Implementing an Infinite Loop in Java:

To create an infinite loop in Java, we can utilize different looping structures such as for, while, and do-while. Since an infinite loop runs indefinitely, it is crucial to ensure that the termination condition is always set to true.

Here is how you can implement an infinite loop using each looping structure:

    Using a for Loop:

    for (;;) {
     // Code block to be executed infinitely
    }

    Using a while Loop:

    while (true) {
     // Code block to be executed infinitely
    }

    Using a do-while Loop:

    do {
     // Code block to be executed infinitely
    } while (true);

In all three examples above, the condition for the loop is set to true, 
        ensuring that the loop continues indefinitely without any termination.
